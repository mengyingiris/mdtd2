  <h2>VIRTUAL GALLERY LAUNCH</h2>
  <p6>DECEMBER 10th 6PM CT </p6>

  <section>
<p1>Part One (June ‘21) </p1>
  <p1>A 12-hour showcase of student artist work streamed consecutively online, as well as projected live at physical locations in the Chicago area.
</p1>
    <br>
    <p1>Part Two (December ‘21) </p1>
    <p1>The Time-Based Virtual Art Experience.
Presented and Hosted on the New Art City platform.
</p1>
<br>
  <p1>Part Two of My Dreams These Days is a student-led re-conceptualization of what it means to present in a gallery space. Produced and curated by students for students, the gallery is focused on time based work, including but not limited to:

sound, film, new media, performance,
art and technology, time-based sculpture, etc.
</p1>
  <br>
  <p1>Following the themes of part one, the gallery will consist of three curated stages
with a focus on the following conceptual prompts:
Material, Virtual and Rhythmic.

The goal of this student artist collective is to facilitate
a space for sharing creative visions in a post-pandemic context,
while opening the possibility for an ongoing online archive
for community building, collaboration and discussion.

This virtual gallery is being generously hosted by New Art City, a virtual gallery building platform working with educational institutions across the country to help build the new world of virtual experiences.
